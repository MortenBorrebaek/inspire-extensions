title:  INSPIRE data specification extensions - The INSPIRE Model-Driven Approach

<section>

    <h2>The INSPIRE Model-Driven Approach</h2>

    <p>INSPIRE is a directive about interoperability and accessibility of geospatial data. <em>Interoperability</em>
        means that different systems are compatible and are able to exchange information, so that other systems will
        understand it. There are many different ways about how to achieve interoperability of computer systems, one
        of which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture" target="_blank">Model-Driven Architecture approach</a> (MDA).</p>

    <p>MDA defines a set of guidelines for structuring specifications expressed as models. Using the MDA methodology,
        system functionality is specified as a platform-independent model (PIM). By creating a common PIM, the INSPIRE
        community has achieved <em>conceptual interoperability</em> - we have created a common data specification. The PIM has
        been created using an appropriate Domain Specific Language. In INSPIRE and ISO, this language is the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language" target="_blank">Unified Modelling Language</a>
        (UML). UML is a language that can be used to describe all kinds of aspects of systems, be it organisations or
        software:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Static aspects such as data structure (Class and Component Diagrams)</li>
        <li>Dynamic aspects such as run-time behaviour or business processes (BPMN, Activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram)</li>
        <li>Relationships between people and software (Use Case Diagrams)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To achieve <em>operational interoperability</em>, the PIM is translated to one or more platform-specific models (PSMs),
        using an implementation language such as like Java, Python, or XML Schema. The translations between the PIM
        and PSMs are normally performed using automated tools, like model transformation tools. This is a core aspect:
        Ideally, we &laquo;only&raquo; have to agree on a conceptual model (PIM), and can generate interoperable PSMs -
        even for different platforms - automatically.</p>

    <p>For INSPIRE in particular, the MDA approach brought several advantages with it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Consistent and well-structured approach across the teams working on all 34 themes</li>
        <li>Ability to model cross-theme relationships</li>
        <li>Effective re-use and detection of inconsistencies and errors</li>
        <li>Easy generation of encodings and other artifacts such as feature catalogues and mapping tables</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of particular importance to model-driven architecture is the notion of model transformation.</p>
