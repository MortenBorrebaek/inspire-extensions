Ths model was created in the [European Location Framework](http://elfproject.eu/documentation/specification/elf-data-model) (ELF) project. It was created to determine how well national standards align to INSPIRE. Furthermore, the ELF project wanted to make a profile of INSPIRE with some extensions to determine a pragmatic process. ELF specifications were supposed to be built upon INSPIRE, some themes were extended due to existing products from Eurogeographics, mostly due to requirements from Eurostat. For Planned Land Use, a mapping from the national models to INSPIRE was not so difficult, but it required an in depth study with a UML modeller and a Planned Land Use expert. As expected, the national model has more and stronger semantics. In general, the INSPIRE specification was fit for purpose.

The model was stored in a national UML model repository with SVN, with a copy of the INSPIRE and ISO 191xx models in addition to other national models.
