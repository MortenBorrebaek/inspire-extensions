    <h2>The Extension Methodology</h2>

    <p>In this section, we'll explain step by step how you can design and implement a data model that re-uses INSPIRE data
        specifications. We will focus on the methodological aspects, not on steps in concrete tools. You'll find an
        example of how to use tools in the <a href="/tutorial.html" target="_blank">End-to-End Tutorial Project</a>.</p>

            <td>This section assumes you have basic knowledge of the <a href="/inspire-mda.html#glossary" target="_blank">terms and concepts</a> used in INSPIRE.</td>

    <h2><a name="process" id="process" href="#process"></a>Process Phases</h2>

    <p>This section gives you an overview of the whole process, which has six main phases:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Organise:</strong> Build your working group, define your process and discuss work agreements</li>
        <li><strong>Analyse:</strong> Identify and analyse requirements, evaluate existing models and the INSPIRE data specifications, prioritize work</li>
        <li><strong>Compare:</strong> Compare the requirements with existing models and your work in progress model extension </li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Create or modify your model extension </li>
        <li><strong>Validate:</strong> Test and validate the model extension through implementation on the target platform, data integration, and usage</li>
        <li><strong>Operate:</strong> Deploy and operate the model extension in view and download services</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You will iterate over all of these phases multiple times. Typically, some iterations will take weeks, while others will take only minutes or hours:</p>

    <h2><a name="organisation" id="organisation" href="#organisation"></a>Organisation and Working Agreements</h2>

    <p>First of all, you need to get organised. This means understanding who should be on the working group,
        distributing roles and responsibilities, setting work agreements, choosing tools, and more aspects. Let's start
        with you.</p>

    <h3>Who are you?</h3>

    <p>You will be the champion of the data model-to-be. You will be the facilitator for the team that will design and
        implement the model. As you are hopefully not working alone, you do not need to be an expert at all required
        skills, but you should have the following skills:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You have very good understanding of the domain the model should cover</li>
        <li>You understand basic modelling concepts such as classes and properties</li>
        <li>You are a good technical writer who writes concise, easy to understand prose</li>
        <li>You are a good moderator</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Your Team</h3>

    <p>Any data harmonisation projects needs people with a wide range of skills. A typical team size is 3-10 people, though larger teams occasionally form to define a model. When you build your team, make sure to have the following profiles on board:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Domain Experts</strong>: These people, like you, are experts in the domain to be modelled and know it well from years of hands-on work. They are familiar with the specific shared terminology, but every one provides a different perspective, e.g. from research and from data collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration Expert</strong>: This person will help yout to integrate actual data into the new model, by using data transformation tools such as XSLT, <a href="http://www.safe.com/fme" target="_blank">FME</a> or <a href="https://www.wetransform.to/products/halestudio/" target="_blank">hale studio</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Expert</strong>: This person knows all about specific tools used in the process, such as model transformation tools, modellign tools, databases and service publishing frameworks. Typically, they support many projects and support your activity part-time.</li>
    </ol>
