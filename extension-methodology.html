    <h2>The Extension Methodology</h2>

    <p>In this section, we'll explain step by step how you can design and implement a data model that re-uses INSPIRE data
        specifications. We will focus on the methodological aspects, not on steps in concrete tools. You'll find an
        example of how to use tools in the <a href="/tutorial.html" target="_blank">End-to-End Tutorial Project</a>.</p>

            <td>This section assumes you have basic knowledge of the <a href="/inspire-mda.html#glossary" target="_blank">terms and concepts</a> used in INSPIRE.</td>

    <h2><a name="process" id="process" href="#process"></a>Process Phases</h2>

    <p>This section gives you an overview of the whole process, which has six main phases:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Organise:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Analyse:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Compare:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Validate:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Operate:</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="organisation" id="organisation" href="#organisation"></a>Organisation and Working Agreements</h2>

    <p>First of all, you need to get organised. This means understanding who should be on the working group,
        distributing roles and responsibilities, setting work agreements, choosing tools, and more aspects. Let's start
        with you.</p>

    <h3>Who are you?</h3>

    <p>You will be the champion of the data model-to-be. You will be the facilitator for the team that will design and
        implement the model. As you are hopefully not working alone, you do not need to be an expert at all required
        skills, but you should have the following skills:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You have very good understanding of the domain the model should cover</li>
        <li>You understand basic modelling concepts such as classes and properties</li>
        <li>You are a good technical writer who writes concise, easy to understand prose</li>
        <li>You are a good moderator</li>
    </ol>
