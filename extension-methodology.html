    <p>MDA defines a set of guidelines for structuring specifications expressed as models. Using the MDA methodology,
        system functionality is specified as a platform-independent model (PIM). By creating a common PIM, the INSPIRE
        community has achieved <em>conceptual interoperability</em> - we have created a common data specification. The PIM has
        been created using an appropriate Domain Specific Language. In INSPIRE and ISO, this language is the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language" target="_blank">Unified Modelling Language</a>
        (UML). UML is a language that can be used to describe all kinds of aspects of systems, be it organisations or
        software:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Static aspects such as data structure (Class and Component Diagrams)</li>
        <li>Dynamic aspects such as run-time behaviour or business processes (BPMN, Activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram)</li>
        <li>Relationships between people and software (Use Case Diagrams)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To achieve <em>operational interoperability</em>, the PIM is translated to one or more platform-specific models (PSMs),
        using an implementation language such as like Java, Python, or XML Schema. The translations between the PIM
        and PSMs are normally performed using automated tools, like model transformation tools. This is a core aspect:
        Ideally, we &laquo;only&raquo; have to agree on a conceptual model (PIM), and can generate interoperable PSMs -
        even for different platforms - automatically.</p>

    <p>For INSPIRE in particular, the MDA approach brought several advantages with it:</p>
