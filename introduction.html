        <h2>Objectives and Context</h2>

        <p>INSPIRE, the European Directive establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European
            Community, provides a large number of data models. While these cover many core use cases, they often need to
            be extended to serve specific organisational needs.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.geonovum.nl">Geonovum</a> has commissioned <a href="https://www.wetransform.to">wetransform</a>
            to research and document patterns that are emerging for such model extensions. Together with the INSPIRE
            MIGs and other expert groups, we aim to answer the following questions:

        <ul>
            <li>How to extend the INSPIRE data models in an uniform and standardised way?</li>
            <li>Are we able - based on the currently best practices in Europe – to develop a standardised approach with
                patterns to extend the INSPIRE data models?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a first step towards answering these questions, we have prepared a survey. The questionnaire linked blow
            is about experiences with data modelling and the possibilities to develop INSPIRE extensions. And of course
            to collect all best practises in order to study and develop uniform extensions patterns that already
            exist.</p>

        <h3><a class="anchor" name="#methodology" href="#methodology" aria-hidden="true"></a>Methodology</h3>

        <p>We apply agile and lean principles to standards development:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Iterate quickly</li>
            <li>Integrate and deploy early</li>
            <li>Drive measurable improvement with real data</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For specifications such as INSPIRE this means we analyse existing usage of the standard, measure the
            performance of implementations and then modify the specification. We test these modifications by
            transforming data and by publishing services using the new design, e.g. a model that extends an INSPIRE data
            specification.</p>

        <p>This approach is based on the harmonisation methodology developed in the HUMBOLDT project and then refined in
            more than 20 other projects afterwards. We use different tools for modeling, transformation and publishing,
            such as Enterprise Architect, GeoServer, deegree and Shapechange. In particular, the model driven, data
            augmented design process uses hale»studio (HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor) 2.9.4+ and hale»connect 1.0.</p>

        <p>Our project management methodology is based on agile foundations. For a project focused on services such as
            data harmonization consulting like this one, we use a Kanban approach. Open tasks are documented in our
            issue management software, and all project participants are provided access to the current tasks and status
            information. </p>

        <p>We assure the quality of deliverables through continuous communication with the stakeholders, through
            internal reviews of documents and through continuous testing of software and transformation projects. We
            manage generic project risks actively through documentation, involvement of additional staff and clear
            communication of expectations with project stakeholders. Specific risks for a harmonization project such as
            problematic source data quality are identified in the first phase of the project, and appropriate mitigation
            strategies are identified with project stakeholders.</p>

        <p>The overall project quality will furthermore be ensured by an advisory committee. The advisory committee (AC)
            consists of representatives of representatives of DG ENV, EEA and JRC, as well as of Geonovum and
            wetransform. The responsibility of the AC is to monitor the progress of the project periodically (for every
            milestone) and to provide feedback on deliverables. They will also help to provide access to the INSPIRE
            community through channels such as the MIG-T, MIG-P, LMO and SDICs. The AC is expected to meet virtually
            once per month.</p>
