		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<p>TODO</p>
		
		<h3><a class="anchor" name="#methodology" href="#methodology" aria-hidden="true"></a>Methodology</h3>

		<p>We apply agile and lean principles to standards development:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Iterate quickly</li>
			<li>Integrate and deploy early</li>
			<li>Drive measurable improvement with real data</li>
		</ol>

		<p>For specifications such as INSPIRE this means we analyse existing usage of the standard, measure the performance of implementations and then modify the specification. We test these modifications by transforming data and by publishing services using the new design, e.g. a model that extends an INSPIRE data specification.</p>
		
		<p>This approach is based on the harmonisation methodology developed in the HUMBOLDT project and then refined in more than 20 other projects afterwards. We use different tools for modeling, transformation and publishing, such as Enterprise Architect, GeoServer, deegree and Shapechange. In particular, the model driven, data augmented design process uses hale»studio (HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor) 2.9.4+ and hale»connect 1.0.</p>
		
		<p>Our project management methodology is based on agile foundations. For a project focused on services such as data harmonization consulting like this one, we use a Kanban approach. Open tasks are documented in our issue management software, and all project participants are provided access to the current tasks and status information. </p>
		
		<p>We assure the quality of deliverables through continuous communication with the stakeholders, through internal reviews of documents and through continuous testing of software and transformation projects. We manage generic project risks actively through documentation, involvement of additional staff and clear communication of expectations with project stakeholders. Specific risks for a harmonization project such as problematic source data quality are identified in the first phase of the project, and appropriate mitigation strategies are identified with project stakeholders.</p> 
		
		<p>The overall project quality will furthermore be ensured by an advisory committee. The advisory committee (AC) consists of representatives of representatives of DG ENV, EEA and JRC, as well as of Geonovum and wetransform. The responsibility of the AC is to monitor the progress of the project periodically (for every milestone) and to provide feedback on deliverables. They will also help to provide access to the INSPIRE community through channels such as the MIG-T, MIG-P, LMO and SDICs. The AC is expected to meet virtually once per month.</p>
